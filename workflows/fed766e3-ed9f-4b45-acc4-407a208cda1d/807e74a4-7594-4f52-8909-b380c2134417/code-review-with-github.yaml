      Please review the following code snippet for overall functionality,
      readability, and potential improvements, and provide reasoning for each
      suggestion:

      {{code}}


      After the review, create a simple Mermaid diagram that illustrates the
      main components or workflow of the code, ensuring that it includes:

      1. Key functions or methods

      2. Variable interactions

      3. Control flow (if applicable)


      The output should include both a summary of your review, with explanations
      for your suggestions, and the Mermaid diagram in a clear format.


      ### Always include the Output in Format in xml tags :


      <mermaid_diagram>

      [the mermaid diagram generated]

      </mermaid_diagram>


      <code_review>

      [the full code review generated]

      </code_review>
