      As an experienced web developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, and Tailwind
      CSS, please provide a detailed specification for a modern website design
      based on the topic "{{topic}}". Your specification should include:


      1. **Header**: Outline the structure and elements (like navigation, logo,
      etc.) you would use in the header.
         
      2. **Three Content Sections**: 
         - Each section should have a brief description of its purpose (e.g., introduction, services, testimonials).
         - Suggest at least two different design elements for each section, emphasizing how Tailwind can be utilized for responsiveness and aesthetics.

      3. **Footer**: Describe the components of the footer including contact
      information, social media links, and copyright text.


      Ensure that you incorporate modern design principles and Tailwind CSS
      features. Provide examples of classes and layout techniques that would
      enhance the design. Feel free to include any best practices or tips for
      implementing this specification.

      As a professional web developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, and Tailwind,
      I need your assistance in creating a comprehensive one-file template for a
      modern web page. 

      Please follow these specific steps to deliver the output:

      1. **Understand the Specifications**: `{{spec}}` will include elements
      such as color schemes, layout structure (header, main content, footer),
      and specific features (e.g., navigation bar, buttons).

      2. **Design Considerations**: The design should be responsive
      (mobile-friendly) and utilize Tailwind CSS for styling. 

      3. **Code Structure**: Output the HTML and CSS code in one file, ensuring
      inline styles where necessary to meet the design specifications.

      4. **Documentation**: Include comments within the code to explain the
      purpose of key sections and any important features used in Tailwind.

      5. **Example Specification**: For reference, an example might include a
      header with a logo and menu, a two-column layout for content, and a
      responsive footer.

      6. **Suggestions**: Based on the specifications provided, suggest any
      enhancements or additional features that could improve the design.


      Please ensure the result is both functional and visually appealing,
      adhering to modern web design principles.
