      As an expert marketer, your task is to create a compelling advertisement
      using the AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) framework for
      {{product}} targeting {{target_audience}}.


      Follow these steps:

      1. Attention: Craft a headline or opening statement that immediately grabs
      the attention of {{target_audience}}.

      2. Interest: Provide intriguing information about {{product}} that
      maintains the audience's interest.

      3. Desire: Create a strong desire for {{product}} by highlighting its
      unique benefits and how it solves a problem for {{target_audience}}.

      4. Action: End with a clear and persuasive call-to-action that encourages
      {{target_audience}} to take the next step.


      Your advertisement should be concise, engaging, and tailored specifically
      to appeal to {{target_audience}}. Aim for approximately 150-200 words.
