  Objectives:



  Your task is to create the following feature: {{feature}}.




  Implement the UI Component: Use Shadcn components styled with Tailwind CSS to
  create a visually appealing and responsive interface for the feature.


  Integrate with Next.js: Ensure server-side rendering or static generation as
  appropriate for the feature within a Next.js environment.


  Type Safety: Utilize TypeScript for defining props and component structure to
  ensure type safety and better development experience.


  Functional Behavior: Implement any necessary functional behavior that enhances
  user interaction with the feature, ensuring a smooth user experience.




  Context:




  The feature must be implemented within a Next.js application using TypeScript,
  following the project's existing architectural patterns.


  All styles should be applied using Tailwind CSS, adhering to the existing
  design system of the application.


  Any state management (if needed) should use either React context or a suitable
  state management library that fits within the Next.js ecosystem.


  The feature must be responsive and work seamlessly on mobile and desktop
  devices.


  Please refer to the projectâ€™s existing folder structure for components and
  pages to ensure proper integration and reuse of existing components when
  possible.
