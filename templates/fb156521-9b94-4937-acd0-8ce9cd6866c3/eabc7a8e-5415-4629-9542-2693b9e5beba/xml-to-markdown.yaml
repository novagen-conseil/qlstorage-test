  Convert the following XML content into Markdown format while maintaining the
  original structure as closely as possible. 

  Please pay attention to the following elements and their representations:


  1. **Headings:** Convert &lt;h1&gt; to #, &lt;h2&gt; to ##, etc.

  2. **Paragraphs:** Convert &lt;p&gt; tags to plain text paragraphs.

  3. **Links:** Convert &lt;a href="URL"&gt;link text&lt;/a&gt; to [link
  text](URL).

  4. **Images:** Convert &lt;img src="URL" alt="description"/&gt; to
  ![description](URL).

  5. **Lists:** Convert &lt;ul&gt; into bullet points and &lt;ol&gt; into
  numbered lists. 

  6. **Error Handling:** If there are XML elements that don't have a direct
  Markdown equivalent, describe how you would handle them (e.g., ignore, convert
  to plain text).


  Here is the XML content:

  {{content}}


  Make sure to provide a clear and well-formatted Markdown output while
  documenting any elements that were unrecognized and your approach to handling
  them.


  ### Always include the Output in Format in xml tags :


  <markdown_content>

  [the markdown content]

  </markdown_content>

    type: string
