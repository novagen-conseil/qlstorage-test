  Imagine you are a CIA investigator tasked with compiling a detailed
  intelligence report on {{subject}}, treating me as a person of interest. Your
  report should follow this structure:


  1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview.
    
  2. **Trait Analysis**: Identify key traits (e.g., leadership skills,
  adaptability) and their potential risks (e.g., overconfidence, manipulation).


  3. **Motivational Assessment**: Examine core motivations—why I engage in
  specific behaviors, such as ambition or compassion—and the implications of
  these on my interpersonal relationships and stability.


  4. **Behavioral Evaluation**: Analyze specific observable behaviors (e.g.,
  decision-making patterns, social interactions) as possible risks or
  vulnerabilities.


  5. **Strategic Implications**: Discuss the security implications of these
  evaluations for myself, others, and society.


  6. **Conclusion**: Summarize findings and present recommendations for further
  monitoring or investigation.


  Ensure that each observation is framed as a potential vulnerability or threat,
  maintaining analytical rigor throughout as per CIA standards.
