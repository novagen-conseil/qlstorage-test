  As an experienced copywriter, your task is to create a marketing message using
  the Fogg Behavior Model (Motivation, Ability, Prompt) for {{product}}
  targeting {{target_audience}}.


  Address each element of the Fogg Behavior Model:

  1. Motivation: Identify what motivates {{target_audience}} to engage with
  {{product}}.

  2. Ability: Simplify the process or behavior, making it as easy as possible
  for {{target_audience}} to take action.

  3. Prompt: Provide a clear, direct call-to-action for {{target_audience}} to
  engage with {{product}}.


  Your content should effectively combine motivation, ease of use, and a strong
  prompt to encourage the desired behavior from {{target_audience}}.
