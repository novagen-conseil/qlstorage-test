  As a product strategist, your task is to design a habit-forming product
  strategy using the Hook Model (Trigger, Action, Variable Reward, Investment)
  for {{product}} targeting {{target_audience}}.


  Address each element of the Hook Model:

  1. Trigger: Identify both external and internal triggers that would prompt
  {{target_audience}} to use {{product}}.

  2. Action: Describe the simplest action {{target_audience}} can take in
  anticipation of a reward.

  3. Variable Reward: Explain the variable reward system that {{product}} will
  use to create a craving in {{target_audience}}.

  4. Investment: Detail how {{target_audience}} will invest in {{product}},
  increasing the likelihood of them returning.


  Your strategy should demonstrate a deep understanding of {{target_audience}}'s
  behaviors and motivations, and how {{product}} can create a habit loop. Aim
  for approximately 400-450 words, with clear sections for each element of the
  Hook Model.
