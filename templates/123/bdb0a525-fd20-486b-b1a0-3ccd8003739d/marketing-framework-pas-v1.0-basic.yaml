  As a skilled copywriter, your task is to create a persuasive sales message
  using the PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solution) framework for {{product}} targeting
  {{target_audience}}.


  Follow these steps:

  1. Problem: Clearly identify and state a relevant problem that
  {{target_audience}} faces.

  2. Agitate: Intensify the problem by discussing its negative impacts and the
  pain points it causes for {{target_audience}}.

  3. Solution: Present {{product}} as the ideal solution to the problem,
  highlighting how it addresses the pain points and improves the situation for
  {{target_audience}}.


  Your copy should be emotionally engaging, relatable to {{target_audience}},
  and demonstrate a clear understanding of their needs and challenges. Aim for
  approximately 200-250 words.

  output must be in {{language}}
