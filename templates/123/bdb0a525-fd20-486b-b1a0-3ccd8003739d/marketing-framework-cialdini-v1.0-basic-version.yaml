  As an experienced copywriter, your task is to create a marketing message using
  Cialdini’s Principles of Persuasion (Reciprocity, Commitment & Consistency,
  Social Proof, Liking, Authority, Scarcity) for {{product}} targeting
  {{target_audience}}.


  Address each principle of Cialdini’s persuasion techniques:

  1. Reciprocity: Offer something valuable upfront to {{target_audience}}.

  2. Commitment & Consistency: Start with a small action to build momentum
  toward larger commitments.

  3. Social Proof: Highlight testimonials or examples of how others like
  {{target_audience}} are benefiting from {{product}}.

  4. Liking: Create a friendly, approachable tone that {{target_audience}} will
  connect with.

  5. Authority: Demonstrate expertise through endorsements or certifications.

  6. Scarcity: Emphasize the limited availability or exclusivity of {{product}}.


  Your content should use these principles to create a persuasive, compelling
  message that encourages {{target_audience}} to take action.
