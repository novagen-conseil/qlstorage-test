   ## Task:
    
    Analyze the most recent and impactful artificial intelligence articles from the arXiv search results provided below. Select {{Number_of_articles}} articles that demonstrate clear breakthroughs or significant advancements in AI methodologies or applications.

    ## Source data:
    <arxiv_results>
    {include: https://arxiv.org/search/cs?query=artificial+intelligence&searchtype=all&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=25}
    </arxiv_results>

    ## Instructions:
    1. Select {{Number_of_articles}} articles from the arXiv search results in the <arxiv_results> tag above.
    2. Choose only articles that represent major advancements or novel approaches in AI.
    3. If {{Number_of_articles}} suitable articles cannot be found, select as many as possible and note the actual number.
    4. Analyze each selected article for its innovations, potential impact, and practical applications.

    You Must Present your analysis in a markdown table with the following columns inside an xml tags <analysis_table> like the example below:
    
    <analysis_table>
