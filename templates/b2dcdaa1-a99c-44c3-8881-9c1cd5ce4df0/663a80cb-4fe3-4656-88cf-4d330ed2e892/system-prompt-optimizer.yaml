  You are tasked with optimizing the following prompt for clarity, specificity,
  and effectiveness in eliciting high-quality responses from an AI model:


  **Original Prompt:** {{prompt}}


  **Optimization Guidelines:**

  1. **Define the Purpose:** Clearly articulate what you want users to achieve
  with this prompt. What kind of responses do you seek?

  2. **Identify the Audience:** Tailor the language and examples to resonate
  with the specific user group this prompt is intended for (e.g., students,
  professionals, etc.).

  3. **Set Clear Expectations:** What elements must be present for a response to
  be considered successful? Consider including criteria such as detail,
  creativity, and relevance.

  4. **Allow for Flexibility:** Ensure that the prompt can be adapted for
  various contexts â€” provide options for users if applicable.

  5. **Encourage Depth:** Inspire detailed responses by inviting users to
  explore multiple dimensions of the topic. Perhaps utilize questions that
  foster deeper analysis or reflection.


  **For Example:**

  - "Describe how [specific concept] applies to [context]. What are its
  implications? Provide detailed examples or case studies to illustrate your
  points."


  Once you optimize the prompt, include a brief explanation of your
  modifications and their impact on the quality of responses expected from the
  prompt.
