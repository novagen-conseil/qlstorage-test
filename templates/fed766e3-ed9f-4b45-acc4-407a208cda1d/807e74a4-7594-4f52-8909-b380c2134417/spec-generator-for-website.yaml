  As an experienced web developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS,
  please provide a detailed specification for a modern website design based on
  the topic "{{topic}}". Your specification should include:


  1. **Header**: Outline the structure and elements (like navigation, logo,
  etc.) you would use in the header.
     
  2. **Three Content Sections**: 
     - Each section should have a brief description of its purpose (e.g., introduction, services, testimonials).
     - Suggest at least two different design elements for each section, emphasizing how Tailwind can be utilized for responsiveness and aesthetics.

  3. **Footer**: Describe the components of the footer including contact
  information, social media links, and copyright text.


  Ensure that you incorporate modern design principles and Tailwind CSS
  features. Provide examples of classes and layout techniques that would enhance
  the design. Feel free to include any best practices or tips for implementing
  this specification.
