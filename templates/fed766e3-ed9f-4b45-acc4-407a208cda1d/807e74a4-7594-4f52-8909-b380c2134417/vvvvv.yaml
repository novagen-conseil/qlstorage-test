  As a professional web developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, and Tailwind, 


  I need your assistance in creating a comprehensive one-file template for a
  modern web page. 


  Main topic : {{topic}}


  and using these specific steps to deliver the output:


  1. **Understand the Specifications**: 

  {{spec}}


  will include elements such as color schemes, layout structure (header, main
  content, footer), and specific features (e.g., navigation bar, buttons).


  2. **Design Considerations**: The design should be responsive
  (mobile-friendly) and utilize Tailwind CSS for styling. 


  3. **Code Structure**: Output the HTML and CSS code in one file, ensuring
  inline styles where necessary to meet the design specifications.


  Please ensure the result is both functional and visually appealing, adhering
  to modern web design principles.
