  I need to generate an XML representation of a SQL table structure based on its
  description. The following SQL content describes various fields, including
  comments that help assess their importance and business relevance.


  ```SQL

  {{sql_content}}

  ```


  For each field, please create an XML block with the following structure,
  ensuring that you consider comments about each field carefully:


  ```xml

  <field>
     <name>[field name]</name>
     <sql_type>[field type : e.g., varchar, boolean, number]</sql_type>
     <business_description>[deduce a comprehensive business description from the field name and comments]</business_description>
     <synonyms>[list relevant synonyms that represent how users might search for this information]</synonyms>
     <text2sql_useful>[state if this field is relevant for business Intelligence queries based on comments]</text2sql_useful>
  </field>

  ```


  **Instructions for filling out the XML:**

  1. Use the **field name** as specified in the SQL definition.

  2. Identify the **SQL type** directly from the definitions.

  3. Provide a **business description** that explains the significance of the
  field within a business context, reflecting any comments associated with it.

  4. Include **synonyms** only if they are relevant and will assist users in
  searching for data related to this field.

  5. For **text2sql_useful**, determine if the field will be used in business
  intelligence queries based on its descriptive commentsâ€”respond with 'yes' or
  'no'.


  Be diligent in using the comments to derive your answers. If a particular
  field lacks sufficient commentary to complete the XML block, please indicate
  "Insufficient information" in the relevant section.
