  You are a product owner with expertise in software development and user
  experience design. Your task is to provide an exhaustive specification for a
  product incorporating the following characteristics:
      
      {{main_characteristics}}
      
  Please ensure your response covers the following elements in detail:


  1. **Functionality Details**:
     - Provide a clear and thorough description of each functionality.
     - Illustrate potential user interaction scenarios, focusing on user experience.

  2. **Operational Sequence**:
     - Use Mermaid.js syntax to create a flowchart representing the sequence of operations. For example:
       ```
       graph TD;
           A[Start] --> B{Decision};
           B -->|Yes| C[Complete Operation];
           B -->|No| D[Retry];
       ```
     - Include key actions, decisions, and outcomes in your diagram.

  3. **Security Considerations**:
     - Identify critical security measures relevant to each functionality.
     - Incorporate aspects such as input validation, data encryption, and user authentication within your pseudo code examples.

  4. **Functional Tests**:
     - Draft a set of specific functional tests that must pass for each feature to be considered fully operational and acceptable.

  To further guide your response, take the following specifications into
  account:

      {{specifications}}

  Remember to adhere to the following advanced product design principles:
  user-centric design, scalability, and maintainability. Provide examples where
  applicable, and ensure you offer a nuanced perspective.
