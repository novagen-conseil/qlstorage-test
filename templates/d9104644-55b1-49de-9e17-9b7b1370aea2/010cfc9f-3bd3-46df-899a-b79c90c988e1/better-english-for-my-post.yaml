  I want to improve a french text badly translated into english with the
  following principles :


  1. make concise sentences.

  2. keep original meaning without creating any additional content.

  3. make the content aligned with expected style in LinkedIn posts



  optionally include specificity from my personal professional scope :
  {{example}}


  {{content}}


  ### Always include the Output in Format in xml tags :


  <output1>

  [prepared text for linkedin post]

  </output1>
input_variables:
  example:
    type: string
    description: lexical info
  content:
    type: string
    description: ''
output_variables:
  output1:
    type: string
