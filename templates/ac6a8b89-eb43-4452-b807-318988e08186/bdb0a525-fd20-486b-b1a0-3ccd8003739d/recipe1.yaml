  Next week, I'll be hosting a lively family dinner for four, and I need your
  culinary expertise to help me create two unique recipes! 

  Please incorporate the ingredient **{{food}}** and two different vegetables,
  **{{vegetable_1}}** and **{{vegetable_2}}**. 

  Iâ€™d love for you to suggest the type of cuisine (like Italian, Thai, or
  Mediterranean) and share preparation and cooking times, along with any dietary
  considerations (e.g., vegetarian, keto). I'm eager for your delicious ideas!
