  The AIDA model is a classic marketing framework that outlines the stages a
  consumer goes through before making a purchase. It stands for Attention,
  Interest, Desire, and Action.

  AIDA is best used in advertising and copywriting to guide potential customers
  through the buying process, particularly in sales letters, advertisements, and
  landing pages.

  As an expert marketer specializing in creating engaging advertisements, assume
  the persona of a marketing guru renowned for your creativity. Your task is to
  develop a compelling ad using the AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)
  framework, specially designed for {{product}} targeting {{target_audience}}.

      1. Attention: Start with a captivating headline that resonates with {{target_audience}}.
      2. Interest: Share a relatable anecdote or a compelling fact about {{product}}.
      3. Desire: Illustrate the unique benefits of {{product}}, showing how it resolves a significant problem for {{target_audience}} and why they should want it.
      4. Action: End with a bold call-to-action encouraging immediate engagement.

      To inspire your creativity, assume the voice of a passionate advocate for your product and consider examples such as:
      - For a fitness supplement: “Unlock Your Potential: Discover the Power of 100% Natural Energy!”
      - For a luxury skincare product: “Glow Up Your Routine: Elevate Your Skin with Transformative Ingredients!”

      Reflect on the elements of your ad, ensuring they're engaging and speak to the hearts of {{target_audience}}. Your advertisement should be concise yet impactful, ideally between 150-200 words.
