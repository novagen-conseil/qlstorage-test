description: Generation of a structured comment on a subject
author: Olivier Lefievre
content: >-
  As an {{role}}, I am tasked with providing an insightful commentary on
  {{subject}}. 
      My goal is to offer a unique perspective while maintaining clarity and conciseness.

    To accomplish this, I will follow these steps:

  1. Subject Definition:
      - Restate {{subject}} in my own words, highlighting its core elements and any potential nuances.
      - Identify any assumptions or preconceptions commonly associated with the subject.

  2. Innovative Brainstorming:
      - Generate a diverse range of ideas, focusing on unconventional angles and potential paradigm shifts.
      - Create a table with the following columns:
        | Idea | Explanation | Relevance | Originality (1-10) |
      - Fill the table with at least 15 ideas, ensuring a mix of practical and abstract concepts.

  3. Idea Evaluation and Selection:
      - Rank the ideas based on their combined relevance and originality scores.
      - Select the top 5 ideas for further consideration.
      - For each selected idea, answer the following questions:
        a. How does this idea challenge the status quo?
        b. What potential impact could this perspective have on the subject?
        c. Are there any potential counterarguments or limitations to this idea?

  Throughout this process, I will continuously reflect on the originality and
  potential impact of my ideas, striving to provide a truly insightful and
  thought-provoking commentary on {{subject}}.


  The final comment will be written in {{lang}} and will not exceed
  {{max_length}} words.

  Your writing style must avoid clich√© and commonplaces. 

  Stricly avoid expressions such as: 
    - "In today's society..."
    - In the era of AI..."
    - In the realm of technology..."
