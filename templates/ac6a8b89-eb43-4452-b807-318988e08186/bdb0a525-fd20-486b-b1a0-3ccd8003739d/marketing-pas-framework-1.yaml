  Create a persuasive sales message using the PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solution)
  framework for **{{product}}**, targeting **{{target_audience}}**. 

  Use the headings below and consider these examples of emotional engagement and
  pain point articulation:


  **1. Problem**  

  Describe a critical challenge **{{target_audience}}** faces related to
  **{{product}}** (e.g., "Many busy professionals struggle to find time…").


  **2. Agitate**  

  Explore the negative effects deeply—how does this challenge make them feel?
  What consequences reinforce this pain? (e.g., "This can lead to feelings of
  overwhelm…").


  **3. Solution**  


  Present **{{product}}** as the ideal remedy (e.g., "With our innovative
  solution, you will…”). Highlight tangible benefits and transformations.

  Aim for a persuasive tone that resonates emotionally with
  **{{target_audience}}**. Keep it between {{max words}} words, and output must
  be in **{{language}}**.
