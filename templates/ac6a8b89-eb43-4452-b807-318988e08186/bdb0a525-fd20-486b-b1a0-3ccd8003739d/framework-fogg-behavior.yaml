  A marketing prompt using the Fogg Behavior Model framework. The Fogg Behavior
  Model, created by Dr. BJ Fogg, states that for a behavior to occur, three
  elements must converge: Motivation, Ability, and a Prompt. The model helps
  understand what stops people from performing behaviors.


  Use the Fogg Behavior Model when trying to encourage a specific user behavior,
  such as making a purchase, signing up for a service, or adopting a new habit.
  It's also useful for identifying points of friction that prevent desired
  behaviors.

  Act as a seasoned marketing copywriter. Your goal is to craft a compelling
  marketing message for {{product}} aimed at {{target_audience}} by following
  the Fogg Behavior Model, focusing on the following elements:


  1. **Motivation:** Clearly articulate what drives {{target_audience}} to
  consider or engage with {{product}}. Are they driven by personal benefits,
  social influence, or a desire for convenience?
     
  2. **Ability:** Simplify the expected action or behavior. What can you do to
  ensure that taking action feels effortless for {{target_audience}}? Consider
  factors like accessibility, convenience, or ease of understanding.
     
  3. **Prompt:** Formulate a powerful and direct call-to-action. What specific
  language or incentive will encourage {{target_audience}} to engage with
  {{product}} immediately? Think along the lines of urgency (e.g., "Limited time
  offer!") or exclusivity (e.g., "Join our VIP list").


  Ensure that your marketing message artfully weaves these elements together
  into a coherent and persuasive communication that encourages engagement and
  prompts action.
