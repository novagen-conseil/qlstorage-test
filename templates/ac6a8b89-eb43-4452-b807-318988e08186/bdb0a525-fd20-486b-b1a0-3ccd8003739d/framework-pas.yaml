  The PAS framework (Problem / Agitate / Solution) focuses on identifying a
  problem, agitating it to make it more pressing, and then offering a solution.

  PAS is particularly effective in direct response copywriting, sales letters,
  and advertisements where the goal is to address a specific pain point of the
  audience.
