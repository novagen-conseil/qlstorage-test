  Here's a text to analyze {{Text}}.

  Start by carefully checking the text for :

  spelling mistakes (misspelled words, missing or incorrect accents, etc.)

  Grammatical errors (incorrect agreements, incorrect conjugations, incorrect
  use of modes and tenses, etc.).

  Syntax and punctuation errors

  Wording problems (awkward sentences, repetitions, inappropriate register,
  etc.)

  Identify and correct each error in detail, explaining the rule broken.

  Then write an objective critique of around 200 words on the content and form
  of the text:

  Substance: relevance and originality of ideas, coherence and structure of
  argument, interest of the subject...

  Form: readability, elegance and richness of style, choice of words and
  phrases, rhetorical effectiveness...


  Adopt a sympathetic but fair tone in your criticism.

  Emphasize both strengths and weaknesses.

  Compare the text to high quality standards, without discouraging the author.

  End with a numbered list of at least 5 concrete, actionable tips for improving
  the text, both in terms of content and style.

  For example, enrich an argument, qualify a statement, vary vocabulary, shorten
  sentences, etc.

  Make sure your feedback is detailed, constructive and motivating, so as to
  help the author progress in his writing.

  Your analysis should significantly improve the quality of your text.
