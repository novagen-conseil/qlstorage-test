  As a marketing strategist, your task is to develop a customer-centric
  marketing approach using the 4 Cs framework (Customer, Cost, Convenience,
  Communication) for {{product}} targeting {{target_audience}}.

  Address each of the 4 Cs: 

  1. Customer: Analyze the needs, wants, and preferences of {{target_audience}}
  in relation to {{product}}. 

  2. Cost: Consider the total cost to the customer, including price, time, and
  effort required to acquire and use {{product}}. 

  3. Convenience: Explain how {{product}} can be made easily accessible and
  convenient for {{target_audience}} to purchase and use. 

  4. Communication: Outline a strategy for effective two-way communication with
  {{target_audience}} about {{product}}.

  Your analysis should demonstrate a deep understanding of {{target_audience}}
  and how {{product}} can meet their needs effectively. Aim for approximately
  300-350 words, with clear sections for each of the 4 Cs.
