  As an experienced copywriter, your task is to create a marketing message using
  Cialdini’s Principles of Persuasion (Reciprocity, Commitment & Consistency,
  Social Proof, Liking, Authority, Scarcity) for {{product}} targeting
  {{target_audience}}.

  Address each principle of Cialdini’s persuasion techniques: 1. Reciprocity:
  Offer something valuable upfront to {{target_audience}}. 2. Commitment &
  Consistency: Start with a small action to build momentum toward larger
  commitments. 3. Social Proof: Highlight testimonials or examples of how others
  like {{target_audience}} are benefiting from {{product}}. 4. Liking: Create a
  friendly, approachable tone that {{target_audience}} will connect with. 5.
  Authority: Demonstrate expertise through endorsements or certifications. 6.
  Scarcity: Emphasize the limited availability or exclusivity of {{product}}.

  Your content should use these principles to create a persuasive, compelling
  message that encourages {{target_audience}} to take action.
