  As a marketing manager, your task is to develop a comprehensive marketing
  strategy using the 4 Ps framework (Product, Price, Place, Promotion) for
  {{product}} targeting {{target_audience}}.


  Address each of the 4 Ps: 

  1. Product: Describe {{product}} in detail, including its features, benefits,
  and how it meets the needs of {{target_audience}}. 

  2. Price: Determine an appropriate pricing strategy for {{product}},
  considering factors such as production costs, competitor pricing, and
  {{target_audience}}'s willingness to pay. 

  3. Place: Outline the distribution channels and methods to make {{product}}
  available to {{target_audience}}. 

  4. Promotion: Develop a promotional strategy to effectively communicate the
  value of {{product}} to {{target_audience}}.


  Your marketing strategy should be well-researched, data-driven, and aligned
  with the goals of reaching and appealing to {{target_audience}}. Aim for
  approximately 400-450 words, with clear sections for each of the 4 Ps.
