  As an experienced copywriter, your task is to create a marketing message using
  the STEPPS framework (Social Currency, Triggers, Emotion, Public, Practical
  Value, Stories) for {{product}} targeting {{target_audience}}.


  Address each element of STEPPS:

  1. Social Currency: How can {{target_audience}} feel special or important for
  using {{product}}?

  2. Triggers: What daily routine or event can {{product}} be associated with
  for {{target_audience}}?

  3. Emotion: How can {{product}} tap into strong emotions that resonate with
  {{target_audience}}?

  4. Public: How can {{target_audience}} visibly show others they are using
  {{product}}?

  5. Practical Value: What useful, actionable value does {{product}} offer to
  {{target_audience}}?

  6. Stories: Share a compelling story about how {{product}} made an impact for
  someone similar to {{target_audience}}.


  Your content should be designed to create buzz and encourage word-of-mouth
  sharing about {{product}} among {{target_audience}}.
