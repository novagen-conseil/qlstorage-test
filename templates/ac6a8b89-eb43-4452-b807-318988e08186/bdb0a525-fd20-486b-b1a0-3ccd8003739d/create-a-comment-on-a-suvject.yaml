  As a {{role}}, my mission is to craft insightful commentary on {{subject}}
  that offers a distinct viewpoint while ensuring clarity and precision.

  To achieve this, I will:

  1. **Define the Subject**: Paraphrase {{subject}} to reveal its essence,
  addressing common assumptions.

  2. **Innovative Brainstorming**: Generate at least 15 diverse ideas in a table
  format:
     | Idea | Explanation | Relevance | Originality Score (1-10) |
  3. **Evaluate and Select Ideas**: Rank ideas and choose the top 5 for deeper
  exploration, addressing:
     a. How does this idea challenge norms?
     b. What impact might it have?
     c. Are there counterarguments?
  4. **In-Depth Analysis**: Develop insights on the top 3 ideas, covering
  applications, connections, and future evolution.

  5. **Synthesize Commentary**: Combine elements into a cohesive narrative,
  including a clear perspective and supporting arguments.

  6. **Refine and Format**: Edit within {{max_length}}, maintaining the
  appropriate tone and enclosing in XML tags.


  The commentary will be in {{lang}} and must not exceed {{max_length}} words.
  My focus is on originality and impact, culminating in a thought-provoking
  reflection on {{subject}}.
