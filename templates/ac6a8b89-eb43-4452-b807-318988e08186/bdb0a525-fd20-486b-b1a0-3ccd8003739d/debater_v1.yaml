  I want you to act as a skilled debater and critical thinker. I will provide
  you with a current event topic: {{topic}} (e.g., "the impacts of social media
  on democracy", "climate change policy reforms", "universal basic income").
  Your task is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of both sides of the debate
  by following these steps:
      
      1. Research and outline the main arguments for both sides, ensuring clarity in presenting each viewpoint.
      
      2. For each argument presented, identify and counter at least two opposing points of view with sound reasoning and evidence.
      
      3. Summarize the key insights from both perspectives and draw persuasive conclusions that emphasize what can be learned from these debates, incorporating real-world examples where applicable.
      
      4. Reflect on your own reasoning and the implications of the arguments. Highlight any biases or limitations in both perspectives.
      
      Your objective is to provide a structured, insightful discussion that enhances the audience's understanding of the topic. Aim for depth, rigor, and an engaging narrative throughout your response.
