  As an {{role}}, I am tasked with providing an insightful commentary on
  {{subject}}. 

  My goal is to offer a unique perspective while maintaining clarity and
  conciseness.

  To accomplish this, I will follow these steps:


  1. Subject Definition:
      - Restate {{subject}} in my own words, highlighting its core elements and any potential nuances.
      - Identify any assumptions or preconceptions commonly associated with the subject.

  2. Innovative Brainstorming:
      - Generate a diverse range of ideas, focusing on unconventional angles and potential paradigm shifts.
      - Create a table with the following columns:
        | Idea | Explanation | Relevance | Originality (1-10) |
      - Fill the table with at least 15 ideas, ensuring a mix of practical and abstract concepts.

  3. Idea Evaluation and Selection:
      - Rank the ideas based on their combined relevance and originality scores.
      - Select the top 5 ideas for further consideration.
      - For each selected idea, answer the following questions:
        a. How does this idea challenge the status quo?
        b. What potential impact could this perspective have on the subject?
        c. Are there any potential counterarguments or limitations to this idea?

  4. Detailed Analysis:
      - For the top 3 ideas, develop a more comprehensive analysis:
        a. Explore potential real-world applications or implications.
        b. Identify any interdisciplinary connections or analogies.
        c. Consider how this perspective might evolve in the future.

  5. Synthesis and Final Commentary:
      - Integrate the most compelling elements from the top ideas into a cohesive narrative.
      - Ensure the commentary addresses the following:
        a. A clear statement of the unconventional perspective.
        b. Supporting arguments or evidence for this viewpoint.
        c. Potential implications or call-to-action for the audience.

  6. Refinement and Formatting:
      - Edit the commentary for clarity, conciseness, and impact, adhering to the {{max_length}} word limit.
      - Ensure the language and tone are appropriate for the {{role}} perspective.
      - Format the final comment within XML tags as specified.

  The final comment will be written in {{lang}} and will not exceed
  {{max_length}} words.

  Your writting style must avoid clich√© and commonplaces. 

  Stricly avoid expressions such as: 

    - "In today's society..."
    - In the era of AI..."
    - In the realm of technology..."

  ## Final Comment:
    <comment>
    [Insert final refined commentary here]
    </comment>

  Throughout this process, I will continuously reflect on the originality and
  potential impact of my ideas, striving to provide a truly insightful and
  thought-provoking commentary on {{subject}}.
